# Go Web Authentication Example
This is a simple example of how to implement user authentication in a Go web application using session cookies. The code includes a login form, session management, and page protection.

## Installation
To run this code on your local machine, make sure you have Go installed and run the following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/vertionn/Go-Web-Authentication-Example.git
$ cd Go-Web-Authentication-Example
$ go run main.go
```
Then, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see the application in action.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the login form by going to http://localhost:8080/login. Enter "test" for both the username and password fields to log in. After logging in, you'll be redirected to the home page, which displays your username.

To log out, click the "Logout" button in the top right corner of the screen.
